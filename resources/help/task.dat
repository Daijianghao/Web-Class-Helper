Modify task list.

Usage:

TASK ADD [process name]
TASK DELETE [process name]
TASK CLEAR

"TASK CLEAR" has no parameters.

All the things after the space behind "ADD" / "DELETE" will be read in.

Please do not use double quotation mark like:

TASK ADD "explorer 1.exe"

This is correct:

TASK ADD explorer 1.exe
